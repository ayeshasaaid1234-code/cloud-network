Cloud computing has transformed modern networking by enabling organizations to combine on premises resources with cloud services. Hybrid cloud networks allow secure access to internal services while providing scalability through cloud platforms. This project simulates a hybrid network where local servers and PCs communicate with cloud resources using Cisco Packet Tracer.
4. Objectives
 Design a functional hybrid cloud network topology.
 Configure IP addressing, servers, and wireless access points.
 Test LAN, WLAN, and cloud connectivity using simulation tools.
 Understand cloud–LAN communication flows.
